# House Prices - Kaggle Competition

This is my attempt at the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict home sale prices using regression models.

## Steps
1. **EDA**: Explored data distributions and missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Handled missing data, encoded categorical variables, and created new features.
3. **Modeling**: Tested Linear Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
4. **Submission**: Generated predictions and submitted to Kaggle.

## Results
Best model achieved an **RMSE** of `0.228`.  
My best score achieved on the Kaggle Leaderboard: `0.13375`  
Came in the top 25% of the Kaggle Rolling Leaderboard.
